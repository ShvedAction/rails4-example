<p class="basic"><b>The History of CLIPS<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">The origins of the C Language Integrated Production System
(CLIPS<!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe
&quot;CLIPS&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:
field-end'></span><![endif]-->) date back to 1984 at NASA’s Johnson Space
Center. At this time, the Artificial Intelligence Section had developed over a
dozen prototype expert systems applications using state‑of‑the‑art
hardware and software. However, despite extensive demonstrations of the
potential of expert systems, few of these applications were put into regular
use. This failure to provide expert systems technology within NASA’s
operational computing constraints could largely be traced to the use of LISP<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;LISP&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]--> as the base language for
nearly all expert system software tools at that time. In particular, three problems
hindered the use of LISP based expert system tools within NASA<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;NASA&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->: the low availability of LISP
on a wide variety of conventional computers, the high cost of state‑of‑the‑art
LISP tools and hardware, and the poor integra&shy;tion of LISP with other
languages (making embedded applications difficult).</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">The Artificial Intelligence Section<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;Artificial Intelligence
Section&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->
felt that the use of a conventional language, such as C, would eliminate most
of these problems, and initially looked to the expert system tool vendors to
provide an expert system tool written using a conventional language. Although a
number of tool vendors started converting their tools to run in C<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;C&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->, the cost of each tool was
still very high, most were restricted to a small variety of computers, and the
projected availability times were discouraging. To meet all of its needs in a
timely and cost effective manner, it became evident that the Artificial
Intelligence Section would have to develop its own C based expert system tool.</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">The prototype version of CLIPS was developed in the spring of
1985 in a little over two months. Particular attention was given to making the
tool compatible with expert systems under development at that time by the
Artificial Intelligence Section. Thus, the syntax of CLIPS was made to very
closely resemble the syntax of a subset of the ART<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;ART&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]--> expert system tool developed
by Inference Corporation<!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe
&quot;Inference Corporation&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->. Although originally modelled
from ART, CLIPS was developed entirely without assistance from Inference or
access to the ART source code.</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">The original intent for CLIPS was to gain useful insight and
knowledge about the construction of expert system tools and to lay the
groundwork for the construction of a replacement tool for the commercial tools
currently being used. Version 1.0 demonstrated the feasibility of the project
concept. After additional development, it became apparent that CLIPS would be a
low cost expert system tool ideal for the purposes of training. Another year of
development and internal use went into CLIPS improving its portability,
performance, functionality, and supporting documentation. Version 3.0 of CLIPS
was made available to groups outside of NASA in the summer of 1986.</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">Further enhancements transformed CLIPS from a training tool into
a tool useful for the development and delivery of expert systems as well.
Versions 4.0 and 4.1 of CLIPS, released respectively in the summer and fall of
1987, featured greatly improved performance, external language integration, and
delivery capabilities. Version 4.2 of CLIPS, released in the summer of 1988,
was a complete rewrite of CLIPS for code modularity. Also included with this
release were an architecture manual providing a detailed description of the
CLIPS software architecture and a utility program for aiding in the
verification and validation of rule‑based programs. Version 4.3 of CLIPS,
released in the summer of 1989, added still more functionality.</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">Originally, the primary representation methodology in CLIPS was
a forward chaining rule lan&shy;guage based on the Rete algorithm (hence the
Production System part of the CLIPS acronym). Version 5.0 of CLIPS, released in
the spring of 1991, introduced two new programming paradigms: procedural
programming (as found in languages such as C and Ada<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;Ada&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->) and object‑oriented
programming (as found in languages such as the Common Lisp Object System<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;Common Lisp Object System&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]--> and Smalltalk<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe &quot;Smalltalk&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->). The object‑oriented
programming language provided within CLIPS is called the CLIPS Object‑Oriented
Language (COOL<!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>xe
&quot;COOL&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:
field-end'></span><![endif]-->). Version 5.1 of CLIPS, released in the fall of
1991, was primarily a software maintenance upgrade required to support the
newly developed and/or enhanced X Window, MS‑DOS, and Macintosh interfaces.
Version 6.0 of CLIPS, released in 1993, provided support for the development of
modular programs and tight integration between the object-oriented and
rule-based programming capabilities of CLIPS. Version 6.1 of CLIPS, released in
1998,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>removed support for older
non-ANSI C Compilers and added support for C++ compilers. Commands to profile
the time spent in constructs and user-defined functions were also added.</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">CLIPS is now maintained independently from NASA as public domain
software.</p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">Because of its portability, extensibility, capabilities, and low‑cost,
CLIPS has received widespread acceptance throughout the government, industry,
and academia. The development of CLIPS has helped to improve the ability to
deliver expert system technology throughout the public and private sectors for
a wide range of applications and diverse computing environments. See appendix A
of the <i>Basic Programming Guide</i><!--[if supportFields]><i><span

<p class="basic"><b>CLIPS Version 6.2</b></p>

<p class="basic"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="basic">Version 6.2 of CLIPS contains two major enhancements. First,
CLIPS now provides a mechanism which allows an embedded application to create
multiple environments into which programs can be loaded. Second, an improved
Windows 2000/XP CLIPS interface is now available and the Macintosh CLIPS
interface has been enhanced to support MacOS X. For a detailed listing of
differences between the 6.x releases of CLIPS, refer to appendix B of the <i>Basic
